<h2 style="color:#2f2b2b;">Project 1: 2D Digital Design</h2>
<p> Goal: My goal for this project was to create a logo encompassing the Southworth planetarium's retro feeling and the reality of the planetarium itself. </p>

<h2 style="color:#2f2b2b;">Project 3: Video Art</h2>
<p>Goal: My goal for this project was to create a cryptid that was both a moose and nature itself made from plants. My cryptid protects Baxter State Park.</p>

<h2 style="color:#2f2b2b;">Project 2: Photo Manipulation</h2>
<p>  My goal for this project was to create a video that showed a difference in how women are perceived versus how they want to be perceived. I ended up focusing on the idea of how they are perceived through premiere editing and old video/ audio clips.</p>

<h2 style="color:#2f2b2b;">Project 4: Interactive Art</h2>
<p>  My goal for this project was to use an ultrasonic sensor to sense the distance between the sensor and the people in the room. My project makes people move closer and farther away from the sensor to speed up and to slow down/reverse the video playing. Three videos can be changed between themselves with buttons.</p>
<p> Here is a link to how the video in the immersive artwork would work. When it moves forward and speeds up that time, it is because the person moved closer to the sensor, and vice versa. When the video reverses, it means that someone has stepped far enough away from the sensor. </p>
